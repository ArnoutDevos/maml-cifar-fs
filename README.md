# Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning on Omniglot, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-FS

This repo extends the original MAML code ([link](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml), [ICML 2017 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400)) [1] with **CIFAR-FS** (CIFAR few shot) classification based on the splits in Luca et al. [2]. It includes code for running the few-shot supervised learning domain experiments, including sinusoid regression, Omniglot classification, MiniImagenet classification, and the newly added CIFAR-FS classification.

For the experiments in the RL domain, see [this codebase](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml_rl).

A report detailing the implementation details and reproducibility can be found [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJx0N2I6IN).

### Dependencies
This code requires the following:
* python 2.\* or python 3.\*
* TensorFlow v1.0+

These results were achieved using TensorFlow-gpu 1.8.0, CUDA 9.0 and cudnn 7.

### Data
For the Omniglot, MiniImagenet and CIFAR-FS data, see the usage instructions in `data/omniglot_resized/resize_images.py` and `data/miniImagenet/proc_images.py` and `data/CIFARFS/get_cifarfs.py` respectively.

### Usage
To run the code, see the usage instructions at the top of `main.py`.

### Results

After 60,000 iterations, with a 95% confidence interval, and 10 finetune steps:
